    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how Spritebot ("the Bot") handles data submitted during use. By
      using the Bot, you agree to the terms below.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Spritebot may collect and temporarily store user-submitted content, including but not limited
      to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Messages and interaction data</li>
      <li>User IDs and timestamps</li>
      <li>Bot usage metrics</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We <strong>do not</strong> sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.</li>
      <li>
        We <strong>do not</strong> use your data for advertising, profiling, or behavioral
        targeting.
      </li>
      <li>We use collected data solely for bot functionality, moderation, and diagnostics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Ownership and Retention</h2>
    <p>
      You retain ownership of your submitted content. By using the Bot, you grant us the right to
      process and store your data as needed for operational purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data is retained only as long as necessary to provide core features or comply with Discord’s
      requirements. When no longer needed, data is deleted automatically or upon user request.
    </p>

    <h2>Deletion and Archiving</h2>
    <p>
      We honor deletion requests in accordance with Discord’s Developer Policy and applicable
      privacy laws. When data is no longer required for functionality, we will delete it from active
      systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some cases, we may <strong>temporarily archive</strong> deleted records for diagnostic or
      auditing purposes. However, this data will be excluded from live bot functionality and fully
      purged within a reasonable timeframe. Archived data is never used for profiling, monetization,
      or external sharing.
    </p>

    <p>
      To request deletion of your data, please contact the bot owner or open a support request in
      the relevant server.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Platform Notice</h2>
    <p>
      Spritebot operates on the Discord platform. For more information on Discord’s handling of your
      data, please see the

        >Discord Privacy Policy</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This privacy policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of the Bot after any changes
      constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.
