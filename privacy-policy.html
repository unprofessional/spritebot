    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how Spritebot ("the Bot") handles data you provide during its
      use. By using the Bot, you agree to this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Spritebot may collect and store user-submitted data, including but not limited to messages,
      user identifiers, and metadata, in the course of its operation.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your information to any third party.</li>
      <li>
        We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for advertising, profiling, or behavioral tracking.
      </li>
      <li>
        We may retain submitted data to improve functionality, ensure moderation, and maintain
        service continuity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Ownership and Retention</h2>
    <p>
      By using the Bot, you acknowledge that all data submitted may be retained indefinitely as part
      of our service logs and internal database. We reserve the right to store, analyze, or archive
      submitted content for operational or security purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Soft Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Requests for data deletion will be honored as <strong>soft deletes</strong> â€” data will be
      marked as deleted or archived but may not be immediately or permanently purged from our
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ensures integrity of internal logs and audit trails while respecting your deletion
      request at the user-facing level.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      This bot operates within the Discord platform. Please review
      <a href="https://discord.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Discord's Privacy Policy</a
      >
      for how they handle your data independently of this bot.
    </p>

    <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>
      This policy may change over time. Continued use of the Bot after any updates constitutes
      acceptance of the revised policy.
